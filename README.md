While AI chatbots like ChatGPT are incredibly powerful, they often fall short when it comes to delivering real-time updates. Although ChatGPT now supports real-time news, it still advises relying on credible news sources for the most current information. With this app, users get instant access to real-time news updates across a variety of topics, including Technology, Automobiles, Sports, the Stock Market, AI, and more. It can also be tailored with custom topic searches on virtually any subject—ranging from EVs, Crypto, and Real Estate to Anime, Tennis, Chess, and beyond.

Web scraping is often considered legally grey or restricted. However, Google News does permit scraping of certain sections, as outlined in its robots.txt file: https://news.google.com/robots.txt. It also offers RSS feeds, but these update every 30 minutes—which doesn’t meet the demand for truly real-time information. This app, however, only scrapes headlines from publicly accessible search results, strictly for display purposes, without storing or allowing redistribution.

The app uses Gemini and Mistral AI LLM APIs to identify top news sources and generate concise summaries. It scrapes headlines and thumbnails using libraries requests and bs4. It also incorporates HTML, JavaScript, and CSS elements to enhance interactivity. Thanks to advancements in web-based interactive frameworks or tools like Streamlit, Solara, Gradio, Dash, Panel, and Anvil have made it easier to rapidly build Python-based web applications.

While Streamlit is excellent for quick prototyping, it still doesn’t match popular front-end frameworks like React or Vue.js in terms of flexibility, smoothness and customization. Its layout and styling are relatively rigid, and also has speed issues, especially with reruns triggered by user interaction. Additionally, it lacks some basic configuration options—like setting a default browser zoom level. Despite these limitations, Streamlit remains a great platform to experiment, showcase scripts, and deliver functional apps quickly.
